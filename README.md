# SWGOH.GG Public Repo

### Where's all the code!?

Unfortunately, SWGOH.GG's codebase is not public. This repo exists as an issue tracker and a place for general information about the site.

### Who makes this site?

The site was started by [sanktanglia](https://github.com/sanktanglia) and [danpaulson](https://github.com/danpaulson). After the launch of mods, [scoot1585](https://github.com/scoot1585) and [drdemp72](https://github.com/drdemp72) joined the (unofficial) team. That is the team to this day.
